The reconstruction process leading to the final 3D map requires an approximate initial model. Generation of an initial model is still an open and challenging problem in single-particle analysis. Results: We present a fast and efficient approach to obtain a reliable, low-resolution estimation of the 3D structure of a macromolecule, without any a priori knowledge, addressing the well-known issue of initial volume estimation in the field of single-particle analysis. The input of the algorithm is a set of class average images obtained from individual projections of a biological object at random and unknown orientations by transmission electron microscopy micrographs. The proposed method is based on an initial non-lineal dimensionality reduction approach, which allows to automatically selecting representative small sets of class average images capturing the most of the structural information of the particle under study. These reduced sets are then used to generate volumes from random orientation assignments. The best volume is determined from these guesses using a random sample consensus (RANSAC) approach. We have tested our proposed algorithm, which we will term 3D-RANSAC, with simulated and experimental data, obtaining satisfactory results under the low signal-to-noise conditions typical of cryo-electron microscopy.

Therefore, cryo-EM can be used to investigate complete and fully functional macromolecular complexes in different functional states, providing a richness of biological insight. In this review, we underlie some of the principles behind the cryo-EM methodology of single particle analysis and discuss some recent results of its application to challenging systems of paramount biological importance.

	abstract = {Motivation Accurately determining the atomic structure of proteins represents a fundamental problem in the field of structural bioinformatics. A solution would be significant as protein structure information could be utilized in the medical field, e.g. in the development of vaccines for new viruses. This paper focuses on predicting the protein structure based on 3D images of the proteins captured through cryogenic electron microscopes (cryo-EM). A fully automated computationally efficient protein structure prediction method would be particularly beneficial in the field of cryo-EM as the technology allows researchers to photograph multiple large protein complexes in a single study, which means that a fast prediction method could allow for a high throughput of derived protein structures. We present a deep learning approach, DeepTracer, for predicting locations of the backbone atoms, secondary structure elements, and the amino acid types. In order to connect the predicted amino acids into chains, we applied a modified traveling salesman algorithm.Results We trained our deep learning model on experimental cryo-EM density maps and tested it on a set of 50 density maps. We found that our new approach predicted protein structures with an average RMSD value of 1.18 and a coverage of 87.5\%. Furthermore, we detected secondary structure information for 87.2\% of amino acids correctly. We also showed preliminarily that 25.2\% of amino acid types could be predicted directly from the 3D cryo-EM density map, considering 20 different types in total. Finally, we noted that the prediction runtime of DeepTracer is significantly improved compared to other methods. It predicts a large protein complex structure of more than 30,000 amino acids in only 2 hours.Availability The repository of this project will be published.Contact dongsi{at}uw.eduSupplementary information Supplementary data will be available at Bioinformatics online.},

Single-particle reconstruction of vitrified samples (cryo-electron microscopy, or cryo-EM) is uniquely positioned to visualize this conformational flexibility in its native state. Although heterogeneity remains a significant challenge in cryo-EM single-particle analysis, recent efforts in the field point to a future where it will be possible to tap into this rich source of biological information on a routine basis. In this article, we review the basic principles behind a few relatively new and generally applicable methods that show particular promise as tools to analyze macromolecular flexibility.

New methodologies for the analysis of single-particle projection images have been added to classification, contrast transfer function correction, angular assignment, 3D reconstruction, reconstruction of crystals, etc. In addition, the package has been extended with functionalities for 2D crystal and electron tomography data. Furthermore, its current implementation in C++, with a highly modular design of well-documented data structures and functions, offers a convenient environment for the development of novel algorithms.

    ABSTRACT = {Cryogenic Electron Microscopy (Cryo-EM) has been established as one of the key players in Structural Biology. It can reconstruct a 3D model of the sample at the near-atomic resolution, which led to a Method of the year award by Nature, and the Nobel Prize in 2017. With the growing number of facilities, faster microscopes, and new imaging techniques, new algorithms are needed to process the so-called movies data produced by the microscopes in real-time, while preserving a high resolution and maximum of additional information. In this article, we present a new algorithm used for movie alignment, called FlexAlign. FlexAlign is able to correctly compensate for the shift produced during the movie acquisition on-the-fly, using the current generation of hardware. The algorithm performs a global and elastic local registration of the movie frames using Cross-Correlation and B-spline interpolation for high precision. We show that our execution time is compatible with real-time correction and that we preserve the high-resolution information up to high frequency.},

    abstract = {Image processing in cryogenic electron tomography (cryoET) is currently at a similar state as Single Particle Analysis (SPA) in cryogenic electron microscopy (cryoEM) was a few years ago. Its data processing workflows are far from being well defined and the user experience is still not smooth. Moreover, file formats of different software packages and their associated metadata are not standardized, mainly since different packages are developed by different groups, focusing on different steps of the data processing pipeline. The Scipion framework, originally developed for SPA (de la Rosa-Trevín et al., 2016), has a generic python workflow engine that gives it the versatility to be extended to other fields, as demonstrated for model building (Martínez et al., 2020). In this article, we provide an extension of Scipion based on a set of tomography plugins (referred to as ScipionTomo hereafter), with a similar purpose: to allow users to be focused on the data processing and analysis instead of having to deal with multiple software installation issues and the inconvenience of switching from one to another, converting metadata files, managing possible incompatibilities, scripting (writing a simple program in a language that the computer must convert to machine language each time the program is run), etcetera. Additionally, having all the software available in an integrated platform allows comparing the results of different algorithms trying to solve the same problem. In this way, the commonalities and differences between estimated parameters shed light on which results can be more trusted than others. ScipionTomo is developed by a collaborative multidisciplinary team composed of Scipion team engineers, structural biologists, and in some cases, the developers whose software packages have been integrated. It is open to anyone in the field willing to contribute to this project. The result is a framework extension that combines the acquired knowledge of Scipion developers in close collaboration with third-party developers, and the on-demand design of functionalities requested by beta testers applying this solution to actual biological problems.}

    abstract = {Three-dimensional (3D) structure determination by single particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryoEM) involves the calculation of an initial 3D model, followed by extensive iterative improvement of the orientation determination of the individual particle images and the resulting 3D map. Because there is much more noise than signal at high resolution in the images, this creates the possibility of noise reinforcement in the 3D map, which can give a false impression of the resolution attained. The balance between signal and noise in the final map at its limiting resolution depends on the image processing procedure and is not easily predicted. There is a growing awareness in the cryoEM community of how to avoid such over-fitting and over-estimation of resolution. Equally, there has been a reluctance to use the two principal methods of avoidance because they give lower resolution estimates, which some people believe are too pessimistic. Here we describe a simple test that is compatible with any image processing protocol. The test allows measurement of the amount of signal and the amount of noise from overfitting that is present in the final 3D map. We have applied the method to two different sets of cryoEM images of the enzyme beta-galactosidase using several image processing packages. Our procedure involves substituting the Fourier components of the initial particle image stack beyond a chosen resolution by either the Fourier components from an adjacent area of background, or by simple randomisation of the phases of the particle structure factors. This substituted noise thus has the same spectral power distribution as the original data. Comparison of the Fourier Shell Correlation (FSC) plots from the 3D map obtained using the experimental data with that from the same data with high-resolution noise (HR-noise) substituted allows an unambiguous measurement of the amount of overfitting and an accompanying resolution assessment. A simple formula can be used to calculate an unbiased FSC from the two curves, even when a substantial amount of overfitting is present. The approach is software independent. The user is therefore completely free to use any established method or novel combination of methods, provided the HR-noise test is carried out in parallel. Applying this procedure to cryoEM images of beta-galactosidase shows how overfitting varies greatly depending on the procedure, but in the best case shows no overfitting and a resolution of ~6Å.
