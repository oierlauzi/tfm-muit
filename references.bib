The reconstruction process leading to the final 3D map requires an approximate initial model. Generation of an initial model is still an open and challenging problem in single-particle analysis. Results: We present a fast and efficient approach to obtain a reliable, low-resolution estimation of the 3D structure of a macromolecule, without any a priori knowledge, addressing the well-known issue of initial volume estimation in the field of single-particle analysis. The input of the algorithm is a set of class average images obtained from individual projections of a biological object at random and unknown orientations by transmission electron microscopy micrographs. The proposed method is based on an initial non-lineal dimensionality reduction approach, which allows to automatically selecting representative small sets of class average images capturing the most of the structural information of the particle under study. These reduced sets are then used to generate volumes from random orientation assignments. The best volume is determined from these guesses using a random sample consensus (RANSAC) approach. We have tested our proposed algorithm, which we will term 3D-RANSAC, with simulated and experimental data, obtaining satisfactory results under the low signal-to-noise conditions typical of cryo-electron microscopy.

Therefore, cryo-EM can be used to investigate complete and fully functional macromolecular complexes in different functional states, providing a richness of biological insight. In this review, we underlie some of the principles behind the cryo-EM methodology of single particle analysis and discuss some recent results of its application to challenging systems of paramount biological importance. We place special emphasis on new methodological developments that are leading to an explosion of new studies, many of which are reaching resolutions that could only be dreamed of just a couple of years ago.}

	abstract = {Motivation Accurately determining the atomic structure of proteins represents a fundamental problem in the field of structural bioinformatics. A solution would be significant as protein structure information could be utilized in the medical field, e.g. in the development of vaccines for new viruses. This paper focuses on predicting the protein structure based on 3D images of the proteins captured through cryogenic electron microscopes (cryo-EM). A fully automated computationally efficient protein structure prediction method would be particularly beneficial in the field of cryo-EM as the technology allows researchers to photograph multiple large protein complexes in a single study, which means that a fast prediction method could allow for a high throughput of derived protein structures. We present a deep learning approach, DeepTracer, for predicting locations of the backbone atoms, secondary structure elements, and the amino acid types. In order to connect the predicted amino acids into chains, we applied a modified traveling salesman algorithm.Results We trained our deep learning model on experimental cryo-EM density maps and tested it on a set of 50 density maps. We found that our new approach predicted protein structures with an average RMSD value of 1.18 and a coverage of 87.5\%. Furthermore, we detected secondary structure information for 87.2\% of amino acids correctly. We also showed preliminarily that 25.2\% of amino acid types could be predicted directly from the 3D cryo-EM density map, considering 20 different types in total. Finally, we noted that the prediction runtime of DeepTracer is significantly improved compared to other methods. It predicts a large protein complex structure of more than 30,000 amino acids in only 2 hours.Availability The repository of this project will be published.Contact dongsi{at}uw.eduSupplementary information Supplementary data will be available at Bioinformatics online.},

Single-particle reconstruction of vitrified samples (cryo-electron microscopy, or cryo-EM) is uniquely positioned to visualize this conformational flexibility in its native state. Although heterogeneity remains a significant challenge in cryo-EM single-particle analysis, recent efforts in the field point to a future where it will be possible to tap into this rich source of biological information on a routine basis. In this article, we review the basic principles behind a few relatively new and generally applicable methods that show particular promise as tools to analyze macromolecular flexibility.

New methodologies for the analysis of single-particle projection images have been added to classification, contrast transfer function correction, angular assignment, 3D reconstruction, reconstruction of crystals, etc. In addition, the package has been extended with functionalities for 2D crystal and electron tomography data. Furthermore, its current implementation in C++, with a highly modular design of well-documented data structures and functions, offers a convenient environment for the development of novel algorithms.

Its data processing workflows are far from being well defined and the user experience is still not smooth. Moreover, file formats of different software packages and their associated metadata are not standardized, mainly since different packages are developed by different groups, focusing on different steps of the data processing pipeline. The Scipion framework, originally developed for SPA (de la Rosa-Trevín et al., 2016), has a generic python workflow engine that gives it the versatility to be extended to other fields, as demonstrated for model building (Martínez et al., 2020). In this article, we provide an extension of Scipion based on a set of tomography plugins (referred to as ScipionTomo hereafter), with a similar purpose: to allow users to be focused on the data processing and analysis instead of having to deal with multiple software installation issues and the inconvenience of switching from one to another, converting metadata files, managing possible incompatibilities, scripting (writing a simple program in a language that the computer must convert to machine language each time the program is run), etcetera. Additionally, having all the software available in an integrated platform allows comparing the results of different algorithms trying to solve the same problem. In this way, the commonalities and differences between estimated parameters shed light on which results can be more trusted than others. ScipionTomo is developed by a collaborative multidisciplinary team composed of Scipion team engineers, structural biologists, and in some cases, the developers whose software packages have been integrated. It is open to anyone in the field willing to contribute to this project. The result is a framework extension that combines the acquired knowledge of Scipion developers in close collaboration with third-party developers, and the on-demand design of functionalities requested by beta testers applying this solution to actual biological problems.}
