    abstract = "{Motivation: Structural information of macromolecular complexes provides key insights into the way they carry out their biological functions. The reconstruction process leading to the final 3D map requires an approximate initial model. Generation of an initial model is still an open and challenging problem in single-particle analysis. Results: We present a fast and efficient approach to obtain a reliable, low-resolution estimation of the 3D structure of a macromolecule, without any a priori knowledge, addressing the well-known issue of initial volume estimation in the field of single-particle analysis. The input of the algorithm is a set of class average images obtained from individual projections of a biological object at random and unknown orientations by transmission electron microscopy micrographs. The proposed method is based on an initial non-lineal dimensionality reduction approach, which allows to automatically selecting representative small sets of class average images capturing the most of the structural information of the particle under study. These reduced sets are then used to generate volumes from random orientation assignments. The best volume is determined from these guesses using a random sample consensus (RANSAC) approach. We have tested our proposed algorithm, which we will term 3D-RANSAC, with simulated and experimental data, obtaining satisfactory results under the low signal-to-noise conditions typical of cryo-electron microscopy.

    abstract = {3D cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is an expanding structural biology technique that has recently undergone a quantum leap progression in its achievable resolution and its applicability to the study of challenging biological systems. Because crystallization is not required, only small amounts of sample are needed, and because images can be classified in a computer, the technique has the potential to deal with compositional and conformational mixtures. Therefore, cryo-EM can be used to investigate complete and fully functional macromolecular complexes in different functional states, providing a richness of biological insight. In this review, we underlie some of the principles behind the cryo-EM methodology of single particle analysis and discuss some recent results of its application to challenging systems of paramount biological importance. We place special emphasis on new methodological developments that are leading to an explosion of new studies, many of which are reaching resolutions that could only be dreamed of just a couple of years ago.}

	abstract = {Motivation Accurately determining the atomic structure of proteins represents a fundamental problem in the field of structural bioinformatics. A solution would be significant as protein structure information could be utilized in the medical field, e.g. in the development of vaccines for new viruses. This paper focuses on predicting the protein structure based on 3D images of the proteins captured through cryogenic electron microscopes (cryo-EM). A fully automated computationally efficient protein structure prediction method would be particularly beneficial in the field of cryo-EM as the technology allows researchers to photograph multiple large protein complexes in a single study, which means that a fast prediction method could allow for a high throughput of derived protein structures. We present a deep learning approach, DeepTracer, for predicting locations of the backbone atoms, secondary structure elements, and the amino acid types. In order to connect the predicted amino acids into chains, we applied a modified traveling salesman algorithm.Results We trained our deep learning model on experimental cryo-EM density maps and tested it on a set of 50 density maps. We found that our new approach predicted protein structures with an average RMSD value of 1.18 and a coverage of 87.5\%. Furthermore, we detected secondary structure information for 87.2\% of amino acids correctly. We also showed preliminarily that 25.2\% of amino acid types could be predicted directly from the 3D cryo-EM density map, considering 20 different types in total. Finally, we noted that the prediction runtime of DeepTracer is significantly improved compared to other methods. It predicts a large protein complex structure of more than 30,000 amino acids in only 2 hours.Availability The repository of this project will be published.Contact dongsi{at}uw.eduSupplementary information Supplementary data will be available at Bioinformatics online.},

    abstract = { It is becoming increasingly clear that many macromolecules are intrinsically flexible and exist in multiple conformations in solution. Single-particle reconstruction of vitrified samples (cryo-electron microscopy, or cryo-EM) is uniquely positioned to visualize this conformational flexibility in its native state. Although heterogeneity remains a significant challenge in cryo-EM single-particle analysis, recent efforts in the field point to a future where it will be possible to tap into this rich source of biological information on a routine basis. In this article, we review the basic principles behind a few relatively new and generally applicable methods that show particular promise as tools to analyze macromolecular flexibility. We also discuss some of their recent applications to problems of biological interest. }

This public-domain software package was introduced to the electron microscopy field eight years ago, and since then it has changed drastically. New methodologies for the analysis of single-particle projection images have been added to classification, contrast transfer function correction, angular assignment, 3D reconstruction, reconstruction of crystals, etc. In addition, the package has been extended with functionalities for 2D crystal and electron tomography data. Furthermore, its current implementation in C++, with a highly modular design of well-documented data structures and functions, offers a convenient environment for the development of novel algorithms. In this paper, we present a general overview of a new generation of Xmipp that has been re-engineered to maximize flexibility and modularity, potentially facilitating its integration in future standardization efforts in the field. Moreover, by focusing on those developments that distinguish Xmipp from other packages available, we illustrate its added value to the electron microscopy community.}

    ABSTRACT = {Cryogenic Electron Microscopy (Cryo-EM) has been established as one of the key players in Structural Biology. It can reconstruct a 3D model of the sample at the near-atomic resolution, which led to a Method of the year award by Nature, and the Nobel Prize in 2017. With the growing number of facilities, faster microscopes, and new imaging techniques, new algorithms are needed to process the so-called movies data produced by the microscopes in real-time, while preserving a high resolution and maximum of additional information. In this article, we present a new algorithm used for movie alignment, called FlexAlign. FlexAlign is able to correctly compensate for the shift produced during the movie acquisition on-the-fly, using the current generation of hardware. The algorithm performs a global and elastic local registration of the movie frames using Cross-Correlation and B-spline interpolation for high precision. We show that our execution time is compatible with real-time correction and that we preserve the high-resolution information up to high frequency.},

    abstract = {Image processing in cryogenic electron tomography (cryoET) is currently at a similar state as Single Particle Analysis (SPA) in cryogenic electron microscopy (cryoEM) was a few years ago. Its data processing workflows are far from being well defined and the user experience is still not smooth. Moreover, file formats of different software packages and their associated metadata are not standardized, mainly since different packages are developed by different groups, focusing on different steps of the data processing pipeline. The Scipion framework, originally developed for SPA (de la Rosa-Trevín et al., 2016), has a generic python workflow engine that gives it the versatility to be extended to other fields, as demonstrated for model building (Martínez et al., 2020). In this article, we provide an extension of Scipion based on a set of tomography plugins (referred to as ScipionTomo hereafter), with a similar purpose: to allow users to be focused on the data processing and analysis instead of having to deal with multiple software installation issues and the inconvenience of switching from one to another, converting metadata files, managing possible incompatibilities, scripting (writing a simple program in a language that the computer must convert to machine language each time the program is run), etcetera. Additionally, having all the software available in an integrated platform allows comparing the results of different algorithms trying to solve the same problem. In this way, the commonalities and differences between estimated parameters shed light on which results can be more trusted than others. ScipionTomo is developed by a collaborative multidisciplinary team composed of Scipion team engineers, structural biologists, and in some cases, the developers whose software packages have been integrated. It is open to anyone in the field willing to contribute to this project. The result is a framework extension that combines the acquired knowledge of Scipion developers in close collaboration with third-party developers, and the on-demand design of functionalities requested by beta testers applying this solution to actual biological problems.}

Because there is much more noise than signal at high resolution in the images, this creates the possibility of noise reinforcement in the 3D map, which can give a false impression of the resolution attained. The balance between signal and noise in the final map at its limiting resolution depends on the image processing procedure and is not easily predicted. There is a growing awareness in the cryoEM community of how to avoid such over-fitting and over-estimation of resolution. Equally, there has been a reluctance to use the two principal methods of avoidance because they give lower resolution estimates, which some people believe are too pessimistic. Here we describe a simple test that is compatible with any image processing protocol. The test allows measurement of the amount of signal and the amount of noise from overfitting that is present in the final 3D map. We have applied the method to two different sets of cryoEM images of the enzyme beta-galactosidase using several image processing packages. Our procedure involves substituting the Fourier components of the initial particle image stack beyond a chosen resolution by either the Fourier components from an adjacent area of background, or by simple randomisation of the phases of the particle structure factors. This substituted noise thus has the same spectral power distribution as the original data. Comparison of the Fourier Shell Correlation (FSC) plots from the 3D map obtained using the experimental data with that from the same data with high-resolution noise (HR-noise) substituted allows an unambiguous measurement of the amount of overfitting and an accompanying resolution assessment. A simple formula can be used to calculate an unbiased FSC from the two curves, even when a substantial amount of overfitting is present. The approach is software independent. The user is therefore completely free to use any established method or novel combination of methods, provided the HR-noise test is carried out in parallel. Applying this procedure to cryoEM images of beta-galactosidase shows how overfitting varies greatly depending on the procedure, but in the best case shows no overfitting and a resolution of ~6Å.

    abstract = {Cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) has become a well established technique to elucidate the 3D structures of biological macromolecules. Projection images from thousands of macromolecules that are assumed to be structurally identical are combined into a single 3D map representing the Coulomb potential of the macromolecule under study. This article discusses possible caveats along the image-processing path and how to avoid them to obtain a reliable 3D structure. Some of these problems are very well known in the community. These may be referred to as sample-related (such as specimen denaturation at interfaces or non-uniform projection geometry leading to underrepresented projection directions). The rest are related to the algorithms used. While some have been discussed in depth in the literature, such as the use of an incorrect initial volume, others have received much less attention. However, they are fundamental in any data-analysis approach. Chiefly among them, instabilities in estimating many of the key parameters that are required for a correct 3D reconstruction that occur all along the processing workflow are referred to, which may significantly affect the reliability of the whole process. In the field, the term overfitting has been coined to refer to some particular kinds of artifacts. It is argued that overfitting is a statistical bias in key parameter-estimation steps in the 3D reconstruction process, including intrinsic algorithmic bias. It is also shown that common tools (Fourier shell correlation) and strategies (gold standard) that are normally used to detect or prevent overfitting do not fully protect against it. Alternatively, it is proposed that detecting the bias that leads to overfitting is much easier when addressed at the level of parameter estimation, rather than detecting it once the particle images have been combined into a 3D map. Comparing the results from multiple algorithms (or at least, independent executions of the same algorithm) can detect parameter bias. These multiple executions could then be averaged to give a lower variance estimate of the underlying parameters.},

    abstract = {Fourier Shell Correlation, Spectral Signal-to-Noise Ratio, Fourier Neighbour Correlation, and Differential Phase Residual are different measures that have been proposed over time to determine the spatial resolution achieved by a certain 3D reconstruction. Estimates of B-factors to describe the reduction in signal-to-noise ratio with increasing resolution is also a useful parameter. All these concepts are interrelated and different thresholds have been given for each one of them. However, the problem of resolution assessment in 3DEM is still far from settled and preferences are normally adopted in order to choose the “correct” threshold. In this paper we review the different concepts, their theoretical foundations and the derivation of their statistical distributions (the basis for establishing sensible thresholds). We provide theoretical justifications for some common practices in the field for which a formal justification was missing. We also analyze the relationship between SSNR and B-factors, the electron dose needed for achieving a given contrast and resolution, the number of images required, etc. Finally, we review the consequences for the number of particles needed to achieve a certain resolution and how to analyze the Signal-to-Noise Ratio for a sequence of imaging operations.}

    abstract = {Measuring the quality of three-dimensional (3D) reconstructed biological macromolecules by transmission electron microscopy is still an open problem. In this article, we extend the applicability of the spectral signal-to-noise ratio (SSNR) to the evaluation of 3D volumes reconstructed with any reconstruction algorithm. The basis of the method is to measure the consistency between the data and a corresponding set of reprojections computed for the reconstructed 3D map. The idiosyncrasies of the reconstruction algorithm are taken explicitly into account by performing a noise-only reconstruction. This results in the definition of a 3D SSNR which provides an objective indicator of the quality of the 3D reconstruction. Furthermore, the information to build the SSNR can be used to produce a volumetric SSNR (VSSNR). Our method overcomes the need to divide the data set in two. It also provides a direct measure of the performance of the reconstruction algorithm itself; this latter information is typically not available with the standard resolution methods which are primarily focused on reproducibility alone.}

Reconstruction of a 3-D volume from raw data obtained from a microscope is highly computationally demanding. Thus, acceleration of the reconstruction has a great practical value. In this article, we introduce a novel graphics processing unit (GPU)-friendly algorithm for direct Fourier reconstruction, one of the main computational bottlenecks in the 3-D volume reconstruction pipeline for some experimental cases (particularly those with a large number of images and a high internal symmetry). Contrary to the state of the art, our algorithm uses a gather memory pattern, improving cache locality and removing race conditions in parallel writing into the 3-D volume. We also introduce a finely tuned CUDA implementation of our algorithm, using auto-tuning to search for a combination of optimization parameters maximizing performance on a given GPU architecture. Our CUDA implementation is integrated in widely used software Xmipp, version 3.19, reaching 11.4× speedup compared to the original parallel CPU implementation using GPU with comparable power consumption. Moreover, we have reached 31.7× speedup using four GPUs and 2.14×–5.96× speedup compared to optimized GPU implementation based on a scatter memory pattern. }

This image-capturing technique, combined with improved algorithms and current data processing software, allows the recovery of different conformational states of a macromolecule, opening new possibilities for the study of its flexibility and dynamic events. However, the ensemble analysis of these different conformations, and in particular their placement into a common variable space in which the differences and similarities can be easily recognized, is not an easy matter. To simplify the analysis of continuous heterogeneity data, this work proposes a new automatic algorithm that relies on a mathematical basis defined over the sphere to estimate the deformation fields describing conformational transitions among different structures. Thanks to the approximation of these deformation fields, it is possible to describe the forces acting on the molecules due to the presence of different motions. It is also possible to represent and compare several structures in a low-dimensional mapping, which summarizes the structural characteristics of different states. All these analyses are integrated into a common framework, providing the user with the ability to combine them seamlessly. In addition, this new approach is a significant step forward compared with principal component analysis and normal mode analysis of cryo-electron microscopy maps, avoiding the need to select components or modes and producing localized analysis.},

Application of this approach to a cryo-electron microscopy dataset revealed two major classes for projections of simian virus 40 large T-antigen in complex with an asymmetric DNA-probe, containing the origin of simian virus 40 replication. Strongly bent projections of dodecamers showed density that may be attributed to the complexed double-stranded DNA, while almost straight projections revealed a twist in the relative orientation of the hexameric subunits. This new level of detail for large T-antigen projections was not detected using conventional techniques. For a negative stain dataset, maximum-likelihood refinement yielded results that were practically identical to those obtained using conventional multi-reference refinement. Results obtained using simulated data suggest that the efficiency of the maximum-likelihood approach may be further enhanced by explicitly incorporating the microscope contrast transfer function in the image formation model.}

AftD has a conserved GT-C glycosyltransferase fold and three carbohydrate-binding modules. Glycan array analysis shows that AftD binds complex arabinose glycans. Additionally, AftD is non-covalently complexed with an acyl carrier protein (ACP). 3.4- and 3.5-Å structures of a mutant with impaired ACP binding reveal a conformational change, suggesting that ACP may regulate AftD function. Mutagenesis experiments using a conditional knockout constructed in M. smegmatis confirm the essentiality of the putative active site and the ACP binding for AftD function.}
