Particle alignment is a core problem in the context of \gls{cryoem}. In the previous section, we have described our implementation of such an algorithm. However, the alignment problem on its own does not solve any real task. Therefore, we have elected to use the 3D refinement problem as a playground for testing the alignment algorithm.

As stated in Chapter \ref{chap:introduction}, the 3D refinement is used to iteratively enhance the resolution of the map. On each iteration, the current volume is projected 

On this section we will describe the logic on top of the alignment algorithm that allows to perform a refinement iteration.
