The main focus of this project is the development of a fast and reliable image alignment algorithm for \gls{cryoem}. Particle alignment is a frequent problem in the context of \gls{cryoem}, but solely addressing the alignment problem does not provide a solution to any practical objective. Consequently, we have chosen to utilise the 3D refinement problem as a platform for evaluating the effectiveness of the alignment algorithm. In this chapter we will describe both the image alignment algorithm itself and its integration in a 3D refinement cycle.
