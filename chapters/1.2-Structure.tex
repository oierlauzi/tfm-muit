The document follows a logical and comprehensive structure to describe the development of a new image alignment algorithm. It begins in Chapter \ref{chap:introduction} with an introductory section that outlines the objectives of the study, providing a clear understanding of the project's purpose and extent. The \hyperlink{chap:spa}{next chapter} introduces the field of \gls{spa}, which is the main use case of this algorithm. This chapter will focus on the image processing workflow that enables the discovery of the 3D structure of macromolecules. Then, the state of the art of the alignment algorithms will be described in Chapter \ref{chap:state_of_the_art}, providing a thorough review of the current methodologies employed. The \hyperlink{chap:implementation}{implementation chapter} provides a technical description of the approaches taken to implement our own image alignment algorithm, covering the compromises and benefits associated to each design decision. This algorithm will be extensively tested, and the results will be showcased in Chapter \ref{chap:results}. The \hyperlink{chap:conclusions}{conclusions chapter} summarises the key outcomes and evaluates the effectiveness and limitations of the techniques employed. Finally, the document concludes with a \hyperlink{chap:future}{future work chapter} that identifies potential areas for further research.
