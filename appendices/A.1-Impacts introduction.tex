This work focuses on accelerating a core problem in the context of \gls{cryoem}, which is a very powerful tool for structural biologists to research proteins and their interactions. This information is very valuable for discovering new drugs and vaccines, which in turn enhance the quality of life of the citizens. 

Due to the direct relation between the project and the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry, it is necessary to analyse all the possible ethical social, economic and environmental impacts of the project. The aim of this section is to go over each of these aspects and describe how this algorithm could have an influence on them.
